# Introduction

I am Norberto Tadeo. I specialize in data visualization and analytics, primarily using Python. Knowledgeable in R too. 

I also like to do front-end (website development) from time to time, as part of academic requirements or as a hobby. 

There is also a copy of my resume on this page. Take a look to know more!
